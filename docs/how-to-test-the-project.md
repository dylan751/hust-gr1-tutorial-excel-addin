## Test the Add-in

1. If the local web server is already running and your add-in is already loaded in Excel, proceed to step 2. Otherwise, start the local web server and sideload your add-in. (See [How to run the project](./how-to-run-the-project.md))

2. In the task pane, choose the `Create Table` button.

4. Choose the Create Chart button. A chart is created and only the data from the rows that have been filtered are included. The labels on the data points across the bottom are in the sort order of the chart; that is, merchant names in reverse alphabetical order.
